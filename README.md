# Weibo Dataset

**V1:** Includes data on 2,106 news items from the microblogging platform in the half of 2023. There are 1,000 fake news and 1,067 real news. The dataset consists of comment data on news spreads and contains **user** and **comment information**.  

**V2:** Includes **11,329** number of news from the Chinese microblogging social media platform. There are **5,661 fake news** items and **5,668 real news** items. Comparable to version 1 (V1), version 2 (V2) expands the data magnitude on the basis of V1. Meanwhile, V2 provides news **multi-modal data**, including **news posts**, **comment collections**, **images**, **videos** and **voice information**. As a result, V2 provides a better simulation of the real environment of social networks, thus supporting downstream tasks.
